# shortcut-sign
 Open-Source Signed Shortcut CLI tool for Linux+macOS

Heavily WIP. Note that this Makefile does not automatically build lzfse and libNeoAppleArchive; you need to navigate to `lib/libshortcutsign/libs/libNeoAppleArchive` and make. You also need to have liblzfse.a at `lib/libshortcutsign/build/lzfse/lib/liblzfse.a`, although keep in mind that you do not need to have libshortcutsign succeed building.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please make sure to report any vulnerabilities inside of shortcut-sign here.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/0xilis/shortcut-sign/security/advisories/new) tab.

Do be aware that most problems will likely deal with libshortcutsign rather than shortcut-sign itself. Report those in libshortcutsign's security page. However, if you do find something that specifically is in shortcut-sign source, feel free to report it here.

For vulnerabilities with the libNeoAppleArchive submodule, report it on [the libNeoAppleArchive submodule security page.](https://github.com/0xilis/libNeoAppleArchive/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
